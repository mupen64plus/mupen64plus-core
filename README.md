Mupen64Plus is based off of mupen64, originally created by Hacktarux. This
package contains only the Mupen64Plus core library.  For a fully functional
emulator, the user must also install graphics, sound, input, and RSP plugins,
as well as a user interface program (called a front-end).

## 1. Requirements and Pre-requisites

**Binary Package Requirements**

  - SDL 1.2 or 2.0
  - libpng
  - freetype 2
  - zlib 

**Source Build Requirements**

In addition to the binary libraries, the following packages are required if you
build Mupen64Plus from source:

  - GNU C and C++ compiler, libraries, and headers
  - GNU make
  - Nasm
  - Development packages for all the libraries above

## 2. Building From Source
If you downloaded the binary distribution of Mupen64Plus, skip to the
Installation process (Section 3). To build the source distribution, unzip and cd into the
projects/unix directory, then build using make:

```
 $ unzip mupen64plus-core-x-y-z-src.zip
 $ cd mupen64plus-core-x-y-z-src/projects/unix
 $ make all
```

Type `make` by itself to view all available build options:

```
 $ make
 Mupen64Plus-core makefile.

```

## 3. Installation
**Binary Distribution**

To install the binary distribution of Mupen64Plus, su to root and run the
provided install.sh script:

```
 $ su
 # ./install.sh
 # exit
 $
```

The install script will copy the executable to __*/usr/local/bin*__ and a directory
called __*/usr/local/share/mupen64plus*__ will be created to hold plugins and other
files used by mupen64plus.

>NOTE:
By default, install.sh uses __*/usr/local*__ for the install prefix. Although
the user can specify an alternate prefix to install.sh at the commandline, the
mupen64plus binary was compiled to look for the install directory in __*/usr/local*__,
so specifying an alternate prefix to install.sh will cause problems (the
mupen64plus front-end application will not find the directory containing the
core library) unless the directory to which you install it is known by your
dynamic library loader (ie, included in __*/etc/ld.conf.so*__)
>
>If you want to use a prefix other than /usr/local, you may also download the
source code package and build with the PREFIX option (see below).

**Source Distribution**

After building mupen64plus and all plugins, su to root and type `make install`
to install Mupen64Plus. The install process will copy the executable to
__*$PREFIX/bin*__ and a directory called __*$PREFIX/share/mupen64plus*__ will be created
to hold plugins and other files used by mupen64plus. By default, PREFIX is set
to __*/usr/local*__. This can be changed by passing the PREFIX option to make. 
>NOTE:
You must pass the prefix, when building AND installing. For example, to install
mupen64plus to __*/usr*__, do this:
```
 $ make PREFIX=/usr all
 $ sudo make PREFIX=/usr install
 $
```

**Custom Installation Paths**

You may customize the instalation of Mupen64Plus by using the options for the install.sh script:

> Usage: `install.sh [PREFIX] [SHAREDIR] [BINDIR] [LIBDIR] [MANDIR]`
> 
>__PREFIX__ - installation directories prefix (default: __*/usr/local*__)
__SHAREDIR__ - path to Mupen64Plus shared data files (default: __*PREFIX/share/mupen64plus*__)
__BINDIR__ - path to Mupen64Plus binary program files (default: __*$PREFIX/bin*__)
__LIBDIR__ - path to Mupen64Plus plugin files (default: __*$SHAREDIR/plugins*__)
__MANDIR__ - path to manual files (default: __*$PREFIX/man/man1*__)

You must pass the same options to the uninstall.sh script when uninstalling in order to remove
all of the Mupen64Plus files.

You should install the Mupen64Plus plugins (libraries) in their own folder. If you install them
in a common directory such as __*/usr/lib*__ and then later uninstall them with
`sudo uninstall.sh LIBDIR=/usr/lib`, it will delete all system libraries.

If you install with SHAREDIR in a place other than __*/usr/local/share/mupen64plus*__ or
__*/usr/share/mupen64plus*__, and BINDIR is not the same as SHAREDIR, then users will have to run
Mupen64Plus with the `--installdir=` option, otherwise they will get an error. The mupen64plus
executable looks in up to 5 different directories in order to find the Shared Data Directory.
The order in which the directories are searched is:

- directory specified on command line with `--installdir`
- same directory as the mupen64plus binary
- __*/usr/local/share/mupen64plus*__
- __*/usr/share/mupen64plus*__
- current working directory

If you choose to install the plugins in a non-standard location (someplace other than
__*$SHAREDIR/plugins*__), then you must set the PluginDirectory parameter in the `mupen64plus.conf`
config file to the directory path in which the plugins have been installed.

## 4. Key Commands In Emulator
The keys or joystick/mouse inputs which will be mapped to the N64 controller
for playing the games are determined by the input plugin.  The emulator core
also supports several key commands during emulation, which may be configured by
editing the __*~/.config/mupen64plus/mupen64plus.cfg*__ file.  They are:
- **Escape (Esc)** Quit the emulator
- **0-9** Select virtual 'slot' for save/load state (F5 and F7) commands
- **F5** Save emulator state
- **F7** Load emulator state
- **F9** Reset emulator
- **F10** Slow down emulator by 5%
- **F11** Speed up emulator by 5%
- **F12** Take screenshot
- **Alt-Enter** Toggle between windowed and fullscreen (may not be supported by all video plugins)
- **p or P** Pause on/off
- **m or M** Mute/unmute sound
- **g or G** Press "Game Shark" button (only if cheats are enabled)
- **/ or ?** Single frame advance while paused
- **F** Fast Forward (playback at 250% normal speed while F key is pressed)
- **[** Decrease volume
- **]** Increase volume

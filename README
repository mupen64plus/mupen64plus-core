Mupen64Plus is based off of mupen64, originally created by Hacktarux. This
package contains the only the Mupen64Plus core library.  For a fully functional
emulator, the user must also install graphics, sound, input, and RSP plugins,
as well as a user interface program (called a front-end).

1. Requirements and Pre-requisites
----------------------------------

*Binary Package Requirements*

  - SDL 1.2 or 2.0
  - libpng
  - freetype 2
  - zlib 

*Source Build Requirements*

In addition to the binary libraries, the following packages are required if you
build Mupen64Plus from source:

  - GNU C and C++ compiler, libraries, and headers
  - GNU make
  - Nasm
  - Development packages for all the libraries above

2. Building From Source
-----------------------

If you downloaded the binary distribution of Mupen64Plus, skip to the
Installation section. To build the source distribution, unzip and cd into the
projects/unix directory, then build using make:

 $ unzip mupen64plus-core-x-y-z-src.zip
 $ cd mupen64plus-core-x-y-z-src/projects/unix
 $ make all

Type 'make' by itself to view all available build options:

 $ make
 Mupen64Plus-core makefile.

3. Installation
---------------

*Binary Distribution*

To install the binary distribution of Mupen64Plus, su to root and run the
provided install.sh script:

 $ su
 # ./install.sh
 # exit
 $

The install script will copy the executable to /usr/local/bin and a directory
called /usr/local/share/mupen64plus will be created to hold plugins and other
files used by mupen64plus.

NOTE: By default, install.sh uses /usr/local for the install prefix. Although
the user can specify an alternate prefix to install.sh at the commandline, the
mupen64plus binary was compiled to look for the install directory in /usr/local,
so specifying an alternate prefix to install.sh will cause problems (the
mupen64plus front-end application will not find the directory containing the
core library) unless the directory to which you install it is known by your
dynamic library loader (ie, included in /etc/ld.conf.so)

If you want to use a prefix other than /usr/local, you may also download the
source code package and build with the PREFIX option (see below).

*Source Distribution*

After building mupen64plus and all plugins, su to root and type 'make install'
to install Mupen64Plus. The install process will copy the executable to
$PREFIX/bin and a directory called $PREFIX/share/mupen64plus will be created
to hold plugins and other files used by mupen64plus. By default, PREFIX is set
to /usr/local. This can be changed by passing the PREFIX option to make. NOTE:
you must pass the prefix, when building AND installing. For example, to install
mupen64plus to /usr, do this:

 $ make PREFIX=/usr all
 $ sudo make PREFIX=/usr install
 $
 
 *Custom Installation Paths*
 
 You may customize the installation of the Mupen64Plus program by using the
 options for the install.sh script:

usage: install.sh [PREFIX] [SHAREDIR] [BINDIR] [LIBDIR] [MANDIR]

PREFIX - installation directories prefix (default: /usr/local)
SHAREDIR - path to Mupen64Plus shared data files (default: $PREFIX/share/mupen64plus)
BINDIR - path to Mupen64Plus binary program files (default: $PREFIX/bin)
LIBDIR - path to Mupen64Plus plugin files (default: $SHAREDIR/plugins)
MANDIR - path to manual files (default: $PREFIX/man/man1)

You must pass the same options to the uninstall.sh script when uninstalling
in order to remove all of the Mupen64Plus files.

You should install the Mupen64Plus plugins (libraries) in their own folder.
If you install them in a common directory such as /usr/lib and then later
uninstall them with "sudo uninstall.sh LIBDIR=/usr/lib", it will delete all system libraries.

If you install with SHAREDIR in a place other than /usr/local/share/mupen64plus
or /usr/share/mupen64plus, and BINDIR is not the same as SHAREDIR, then users
will have to run Mupen64Plus with the --installdir= option, otherwise they will get an error.
The mupen64plus executable looks in up to 5 different directories in order to find the
Shared Data Directory. The order in which the directories are searched is:

  - directory specified on command line with --installdir
  - same directory as the mupen64plus binary
  - /usr/local/share/mupen64plus
  - /usr/share/mupen64plus
  - current working directory


If you choose to install the plugins in a non-standard location (someplace other than $SHAREDIR/plugins),
then you must set the PluginDirectory parameter in the mupen64plus.conf config
file to the directory path in which the plugins have been installed.

4. Key Commands In Emulator
---------------------------
The keys or joystick/mouse inputs which will be mapped to the N64 controller
for playing the games are determined by the input plugin.  The emulator core
also supports several key commands during emulation, which may be configured by
editing the ~/.config/mupen64plus/mupen64plus.cfg file.  They are:

   Escape == Quit the emulator
      0-9 == Select virtual 'slot' for save/load state (F5 and F7) commands
       F5 == Save emulator state
       F7 == Load emulator state
       F9 == Reset emulator
      F10 == slow down emulator by 5%
      F11 == speed up emulator by 5%
      F12 == take screenshot
Alt-Enter == Toggle between windowed and fullscreen (may not be supported by all video plugins)
   p or P == Pause on/off
   m or M == Mute/unmute sound
   g or G == Press "Game Shark" button (only if cheats are enabled)
   / or ? == single frame advance while paused
        F == Fast Forward (playback at 250% normal speed while F key is pressed)
        [ == Decrease volume
        ] == Increase volume
